# ProcRiver
Coming soon to a repository near you.

Potential Improvements:
  -> Soil Hardness
  -> Different Layers for Erosion
  -> Try adding a Sealevel on the boundary?

  -> Add see-through water
  -> Make the drops transport different types of soil
  -> Display the different types of soil
  -> i.e. we can model the granularity of the soil at any point and see how it evolves!
